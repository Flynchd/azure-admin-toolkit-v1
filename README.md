# vm-azure_powershell

This script creates a new resource group, virtual network, subnet, network security group, public IP, and network interface in addition to the VM. If some of these resources already exist and you want to use them instead, you'll need to adjust the script accordingly.

Finally, running this script can incur costs in your Azure subscription. Make sure you understand the cost of the resources being created and that you clean up resources when you're done to avoid unnecessary charges.
